Participants: Judas, Mary

The next morning, following my betrayal, Yeshu was arrested.  
Imperial guards burst through the apartment, cursing and laughing like jackals.  
Yeshu sat at the kitchen table — iron shackles on his wrists.  
Two guards stood behind him, grinning.  
The moment Jan saw this, he went berserk.  
He lunged at me first — fury burning in his face — but then, suddenly remembering himself, he spat:  
“With you, you son of a bitch, I’ll deal later!”  
And threw himself at the guards.  
A brawl erupted.  
Peter barely managed two steps — he got tangled in the folds of his robe and crashed to the floor like a felled tree.  
Thomas, out of nowhere, burst into hysterical laughter.  
He laughed and laughed, like a madman, clutching his stomach, unable to stop.  
Rolling on the floor, he shouted:  
“I don’t believe it… I don’t believe this is happening… It can’t be this simple… I don’t believe it… I don’t believe…!”  
One of the guards swung his sword, and noble Jan fell to his knees.  
I saw something roll across the floor.  
Looking closer, I realized it was his severed ear.  
In helplessness, Jan wept and dropped his sword.  
Through it all Yeshu stayed silent, eyes fixed on me. Not reproach — never reproach — only that same fathomless sadness. Over the din I caught the hush of his voice, meant for me alone:  
“Lilit, take my hand. Lilit, we begin a new chapter in the history of mankind. Then chapter turns.”  
My stomach lurched, but my feet stayed planted. I watched them drag him out, chains clinking, coat half-off one shoulder.  
Guards kicked bedroom doors at random. Behind the last one Mary still slept, breath slow and even. The officer glanced in, saw only a girl curled beneath a blanket, and waved his men on. They shut the door gently — almost respectfully — and left her to dream.  
When the flat emptied, smoke from broken lamps drifted in lazy coils.  
I lit a cigarette with shaking hands. The ember flared, tiny and defiant in the wreckage.  
Outside, dawn bled into the alleys. Somewhere ahead, a hill, a crossbeam, a crowd already sharpening its cheers. History grinding into place — hungry for martyrs and for monsters.  
I exhaled. Rain hissed on the window bars.

For the first time the name Judas tasted like iron in my mouth — bitter, but wholly mine.
