Participants: Judas, Mary

When Yeshu launches one of his trademark speeches, it’s hard not to fall under the spell. People like him are born when sorrow soaks the earth right through, leaving clots of blood on the surface. Yeshu was one of those clots. However I tried, I could never fathom him. To call him strange is to say nothing; he seemed woven of oddities—yet inside the weave you sensed a kind of twisted order.

Winter or summer he wore the same black jacket and, on his head, a black beret. Clothes clearly meant little to him; the real oddities were in the character, not the wardrobe. He voiced his thoughts in a peculiar way—slow, languid, as though granting the listener a favor—then suddenly blinded you with some (usually tactless) question. Refuse to answer and he flared; and when Yeshu flared you kept clear—he could wound with a single bitter word, though he always apologized later.

Humor wasn’t alien to him either. For instance, once on our way back from the market the talk turned to science.

— All these years, — Yeshu said, — and I still don’t know what quantum mechanics is.  
— I haven’t the faintest, I admitted.  
— The only thing I will swear to is this: it was invented by negroes.  
— Negroes?! — I yelped. — What the hell do negroes have to do with it, Teacher?!  
— What haven’t they? — he chuckled. — Negroes invented everything—blues, jazz, human rights, long-distance running… I won’t be amazed if quantum mechanics crawled out of their poorhouse too.

He laughed. I saw he wanted a duel of wits and accepted. Just then a pair of Jews scuttled past.

— Tell me, Teacher, — I pointed at them, — what could become the future symbol of Zionism?  
— I don’t know. Your suggestion?  
— A circumcised penis, obviously. — I roared at my own cleverness.  
— Oh friend! A new swastika made of pricks and payot.  
— Precisely, — I nodded. — But, Teacher, you forgot the noses… So the Jews plan to enslave the globe and a Jewish dictator worse than Hitler is coming?  
— Quite possible.  
— And what will replace the Aryan salute—the arm thrust to heaven?

Yeshu pondered.  
— A mighty erection, of course. A huge circumcised rabbi-cock pointing skyward.  
— Then how do we tell the real Jew from the fake circumcised impostor?  
— A true Jew gets hard not only for a leering wench but for a hundred-dollar bill.

There we go, I thought—he’d seized the initiative again. I tried to fix it:

— So in other words a true Jew is aroused by that shaggy grey gentleman with frog-eyes bulging?  
— Thus we see: frogs turn a Jew on! — He slapped my shoulder.  
— Which means a real Jew is French, I mused. Then I must be brave d’Artagnan and you, Teacher, silent wise Athos?  
— Yes, yes, — Yeshu nodded, — so spoke and acted the warriors of Charlemagne’s day; a model for every true cavalier.  
— But Teacher! If Jews are French, who then are the French?  
— Well… From what I hear the French come from Algeria, Iraq or Syria. Friends of mine visited France — full of Arabs.  
— And so?  
— Jews and Arabs are the same thing.  
— Ah! Then Sheikh Nasrallah is a wise rabbi?!  
— No, friend — Nasrallah’s a Krishnaite.  
— A Krishnaite? But wait, Teacher — “Krishnaite” rhymes with “kike”… there’s something to that. Swear to God, there is…  
— And “brahmin” rhymes with “rabbi.”  
— Teacher! — I declared. — This discovery will make our names!  
— Hold your fame, Judas, hold it! — Yeshu waved me down. — Answer this instead: why does the Indian branch of kikes, while shunning beef, shamelessly gobble pork?

I was done. Beaten again. He’d proved himself a virtuoso orator. I sighed.  
Yeshu nodded, almost kindly.  
— Sometimes, — he said, — a pointless chat helps me survive the gloom. Thank you, Judas.

The rest of the walk home he kept silent.  
For all the bursts of mirth that seized him at times, he was the saddest man I ever met — but not with the self-pity of preeners. He detested his sadness, fought it — vainly. Joking, you felt his heart tearing.  
— A smile, — he loved to repeat, — a plain smile is worth all the tears humanity ever shed, all its griefs.  
Yeshu cherished the power he held over us yet constantly said he neither wanted nor accepted it — and we’d plead with him to stay. He saw through people, yet could be naïve and trusting, which landed him in scrapes. Once we found him behind a market — beaten, spat upon. He took long to come round, and when he did he flatly refused to say what happened. From then on we sent Jan with him when possible — the strongest of us. The main thing was to avoid fatal accidents.  
We valued him too much.
