The peephole blacked out for a sec. Then a key snarled in the lock.
Yakov swung the door open. The prick was all tuxed up, bow-tie and everything.
— Ah… It’s you…
— You’re damn right it’s me, —I said. — How’s it hanging?
— Mm-hmm.
Yakov eyeballed my feet.
— What?
— Shoes off. Look at you… You’ll track mud everywhere, — Yakov grumbled. — I know you don’t give a shit, but I’m the one scrubbing up.
— Scrubbing the shit I couldn’t care less about?
Rain was dumping outside; I was soaked head to toe.
— Get in already, — Yakov said. — Everybody’s here. Even Peter. — He smirked.
— How’s the Teacher?
— Upset.
— Upset? Why?
— How would I know… — Yakov shrugged. — Says he’s got a “feeling.”
— Curious, what kind…
— Don’t know. If I knew his mind, I’d be the Teacher myself.
Classic Yakov: obsessed with spotless floors and that thick-headed bootlicking for the Teacher — bootlicking laced with envy, dark, dull, and gray as fuck.
I hung up my coat, yanked off my shoes and soggy socks, and crossed the creaky parquet into the sitting room.
— Peace to this house! — I scanned the crew.
Yeah, everyone was here. Thomas sat off to the side, sneering like he was above it all. Andrew, as always, was meek and mute. And Mary… Mary slept softly on the couch; my eyes lingered on her a beat too long. Then I turned to Peter — true to form: a flashy, trashy dress, wig, cigarette pinched delicately between manicured fingers. His face gave away zilch — no joy, no worry. Peter floated outside whatever shit was going down here. God knows why the Teacher kept him around.
Cantankerous Peter devoured Mary with his eyes. He was jealous of her spot in the Teacher’s good graces.
“Yeshu,” Peter once whined to him, “why so much honor for her?”
“Let it go,” the Teacher waved lazily.
“But she’s a whore.”
“So are you… so are we all in a sense, my friend,” Yeshu said.
“Teacher, she’s for sale, body and soul!” Peter pushed.
“And you know her soul as well as her body?”
Silence.
“Answer, Peter, I’m waiting.” — Yeshu locked eyes with him. — “You know her soul? If yes, step right up, take my place, lead us your own way — I’ll be the first to follow.”
Peter hated Mary all the more after that, but he never argued again.
He finished his cigarette, stubbed it out, fished a mirror from his purse and started on his lashes.
— There you are! — boomed a bass behind me. — We thought you’d never show!
Before I could react, good-natured Jan crushed me in a hug; my ribs popped.
The gentle giant had monstrous strength; once, fleeing pursuers, he’d knocked out two thugs bare-handed. I made sure to stay on his good side.
I wriggled free carefully, went to the table, poured a drink.
— Rotten weather, eh? — came Yeshu’s voice behind me; clearly irritated.
— Yeah — nasty stuff. I’m covered in shit.
— Not shit, Judas. Just water.
Alright. Got it. No time to argue. Best to filter every word.
— Ordinary water, — Yeshu repeated. — Same as the tap, only cleaner. If it feels like shit, maybe the problem is you.
— Me? — I couldn’t help it. — Why me?
— Picture a bright dry day. You walk these streets, pour yourself whisky, whatever. Would you mention shit then? You wouldn’t, right?
Jan listened wide-eyed.
— Right, — I muttered.
— Water softens a man, my friend Judas, — Yeshu lectured. — What piles up all year becomes a flood in autumn — only instead of ice it’s shards of your soul. Moral? — The Teacher looked around.
— Moral?! — Jan blurted, impatient.
Thomas smirked. Peter pretended not to listen.
— Simple, — I said. — Leaving your umbrella home on a rainy day is a grave sin.
Silence settled. Jan shook his head sadly. Peter eyed Yeshu, unsure how to react. Yakov instinctively reached for a broom.
Yeshu’s gaze fixed on me. In a scarcely audible whisper he said:
“Lilit, take my hand. Lilit, we’re turning the new page of humankind.”
A chill ran through me. I wasn’t even sure I’d heard it. Yeshu blinked — as though the moment never happened.
Then we all heard a strangled little hoot. Yeshu was laughing, then burst into full-throated roaring laughter. The sitting room shook, everyone joined in — everyone except Mary, still asleep, and Jan, who looked around in bewilderment.
