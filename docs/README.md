# Chapters

Each chapter of Suppertime Gospel lives in this directory as a Markdown file named `chapter_XX.md` where `XX` is a two-digit number.

- **Edit** an existing chapter by modifying its file.
- **Add** a chapter by creating a new `chapter_12.md` (or other number) and writing the content in Markdown.

After changing chapters, talk to the bot in Telegram and send the `/reload` command so it reloads the latest files.
