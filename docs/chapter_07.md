Savage cursing echoed from the entry. Not Yakov this time.  
Mary tried to slip off Yeshu’s lap — he held her still.

“Another visitor,” he said.  
“The same one?” Jan asked.  
“Exactly,” Yeshu nodded.  
“A lover of… full-bodied women.”

Mary looked drained as hell.  
“…No, you don’t get it! She’s a Madonna! I found her in some Siberian backwater — bella mia! I painted her night after night — I’d have painted her forever!”

A painter burst in — eyes wild — then froze when he saw Peter.  
“I imagined you… differently,” he muttered.

Peter flushed deep red.  
For a second, I almost pitied the artist.  
He circled slowly, sizing us up. When his eyes met mine — a pause.  
Then he frowned.  
And looked away.

“Problem?” I asked. “Name?”  
“Leo,” he snapped.  
“So what’s your problem, Leo?”  
“No problem, señor.”  
“Still,” Yeshu said, “you seem rattled. Speak.”

Leo’s eyes softened toward him.  
“I didn’t expect him to be here.”  
He pointed at me.  
I snorted.  
“Déjà vu.”

“Dear Leo,” Yeshu smiled. “Why do guests from the future keep obsessing over my disciple?”  
Leo sighed.  
“Better you didn’t know.”  
“As you wish.”

Yeshu glanced at me. It stuck.  
Everyone followed.  
Peter, thrilled to be off the hook, grinned. Jan blinked, lost. Yakov frowned.  
Mary’s eyes darkened — her fragile balance starting to crack.

I lit a cigarette.  
“What’re you staring at? Your mothers…”  
“Yes! Yes!” Leo cut in, flustered. “Nonsense — ignore it. Look!”  
He waved a sketch: some wide-faced village girl.

“Lovely,” Yeshu said, not looking. “So, Leo… why are you here?”  
Leo deflated — then caught himself.  
“Señor, I paint. Such people… such faces… They mustn’t be lost.”  
“You want to paint us?”  
“I do, señor.”  
“Then go ahead. We’re yours.”

Yeshu poured the wine.  
Leo started sketching.  
We sat in silence — each lost in our own dread. Life without Yeshu was unthinkable.  
Suddenly Leo crumpled the paper.  
“No! I can’t. There’s no unity in you — none!”  
Thank God, I thought. Unity is the last thing we need.

Suddenly — a stranger stood in the doorway.  
“I’m Alexey Dubrovsky,” he said quietly. “Someone here left their last line unsung.”  
He vanished. Left behind the scent of tobacco — and the faint twang of a drawn string.

“Pathetic drivel again…” Peter muttered.  
“That unity never existed,” Thomas said.  
“How would you know?” Peter snapped. “You just sit there — so sit.”  
“Ah, friends… it’s dark here,” John said.  
“To the blind, everything is,” Peter shot back.  
“Better blind,” Thomas hissed, “than dressed in women’s rags…”  
“Enough!”

I slammed the table.  
Everyone turned.  
“Teacher!” I said to Yeshu. “You’d better say something. Otherwise they” — I pointed at Peter and Thomas — “will tear each other apart.”  
Everyone jumped on it.  
“Yes, tell us!” kind Jan called.  
“Sure, why not…” Thomas mumbled.  
“It’s the best option,” Peter grunted.  
“Well, gentlemen, make up your minds!” Leo pushed.  
“With respect, sir,” Yakov added dryly, “do recall you’re just a guest.”

Yeshu raised his hand — and the room fell quiet.  
His face was heavy. He sighed, long and deep.  
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Leo lift his pencil, eyes fixed on the Teacher — like a man waiting for a storm.

“I want to tell you a story,” Yeshu said. “About a man. His name doesn’t matter. Maybe he’s dead. Maybe not. Maybe you’ve never heard of him. Maybe you know him well. I’ll call him Jaud. Don’t ask why — I don’t know myself.  
All his life, Jaud longed to be part of something — something greater, something bright. He wasn’t unhappy with himself, but a rot bloomed inside, like a tumor.  
He clung to ideals. A cause to serve. A god to worship. A monarch to obey. Every time he joined something, he found a crack in it. A flaw. And soon, he’d be alone again. That was his curse.  
He wrote. Some said he had a gift. But his writing only made things worse. Each line unsettled him. It brought no peace — only more confusion.  
One day he disappeared. Packed up and walked out. He wanted to find a whole to belong to — truly belong.  
He met a group. Their eyes burned with purpose. They had a leader — strange, but kind. Jaud pledged loyalty. And the leader moved cities with words. There were setbacks, stones thrown — but Jaud burned brighter with every blow. At last, he thought he found it.  
Then the leader met a woman. Took her in. Jaud was struck dumb by her. He blushed or snapped when he spoke to her. He knew it was over. She was the crack.  
He grew distant. But couldn’t stay away from her.  
One day, in a crowded city square, the leader spoke to a sea of faces — but his enemies were among them. And Jaud… slipped away. And told them where the leader was hiding.  
As he walked back, he whispered:  
‘I have no name. No flag. No god. I’ve spent my life searching, but found only ruins. People give themselves away like pocket change. But the whole is built from people — not the other way around.  
Yes. I’ve grasped what it means to betray.  
I am the man who dares stay himself.  
The man who drops his rifle and screams: I AM NOT YOUR BROTHER!  
SHOOT IF YOU MUST — I WON’T KNEEL!  
Yes. Only a coward dissolves into the crowd.  
Yes. I’m a traitor. The world will throw stones at me. But I will be myself.  
I’ll climb the highest mountain — and up there, alone, I may grow young again. Not by one year — by a thousand.  
The sun will blind me — I will keep walking.  
You gather to scream in megaphones. You line up in armies for glory. You kneel before your rotten gods.  
I remain alone. I thought I did it for the woman.  
But I did it for me.  
To stop chasing ghosts. To stop selling my smile.  
To be — myself. Because to be is stronger than to be heard…’  
When Jaud stepped over the threshold of the house where the leader was hiding, none of his comrades noticed the change in him.”  

Yeshu fell silent.  
We waited.  
Then he said:  
“If you’ll allow me… I won’t continue.”  
He raised his head and looked me straight in the eye. The old piercing gaze — but now with something else.  
Sorrow.  

“Well, as always,” Peter muttered.  
“What’s wrong, Teacher?” Jan asked.  
“I’m not in the mood,” Yeshu said.  
He nodded at Leo. “I’m worried about the future.”  
“What about it?”  
“The future…” he paused. “I’ll lose one of you. Or all of you. Or… one of you will take me from the rest.”

Jan and Yakov jumped to their feet. A knife flashed in Jan’s hand.  
Leo froze, pencil in the air.  
“Who is he?!” Jan roared.  
“Show him to me, Teacher!”  
“Easy, buddy,” Yeshu waved lazily.  
“Show me! So I can cut his heart out!”  
“You’re bloodthirsty,” Yeshu smiled.  
“But, Teacher! At least a hint…”  

Yeshu paused.  
“I don’t know yet,” he said. “Could be anyone.”  
A beat.  
Then he added:  
“For example… him.”  
Yeshu pointed at me.  
My throat clenched. Mary stirred — eyes on me, wide with unease. She didn’t know what it meant. But she felt it.  
And the room — for one second — tilted. Caught between prophecy and choice.  
In the hallway, Leo sketched like mad — trying to trap ghosts on paper.
