Participants: Judas, Mary

Before she met us, Mary sold fruit in the streets. She came from the edge of town — some rough, torn-up place.

From what little she told us, she was about twenty. Her father, Shlomo, was a merchant.

She told us he used to beat her. With orange crate slats.  
Hard.  
Sometimes for a reason. Sometimes just because.

She looked strange — not ugly, but strange. Black curls. Dark eyes. Skin like chalk.  
A scared child.

His fists had scrambled something in her head. Not crazy — not fully — but something was off.  
She’d miss the meaning of simple words. Yakov or Peter would slap her for it.  
Quick hands. No patience.

But I’m getting ahead.

It started one morning. Yeshu said he was going to town. We offered to come. He said no.  
Said he wanted to be alone. Didn’t want company.  
It was cold. Even for him.

‘Teacher!’ Jan called. ‘Why push us away? Did we do something wrong?’  
Yeshu didn’t answer. Yeshu answered with a long, contemptuous stare and walked out.  
He stayed out all day. By evening, we were nervous. Started arguing who should go find him. Almost fought.  
Then — the doorbell.

‘What’s all the noise?’ Yeshu said, walking in.  
‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘We were… worried.’  
‘Yes, worried!’ Jan shouted. ‘We almost went looking for you!’  
He got a slap for that.  
Hard.  
Yeshu’s eyes burned.  
He breathed slow — forcing it down.  
Then said:  
‘Don’t ever do that again.’

After that, his disappearances became routine. He’d rise while we still slept and return when we were tied in knots. Wandering alone he risked his life, but the memory of that slap kept us obedient.

Until one evening he simply didn’t come back. We sat through supper in silence, too scared of his anger to act, too scared of losing him to stay still. Even mighty Jan had been shaken by the slap—what chance had the rest of us? Worse, disobedience could mean banishment—and nobody wanted that.

We drifted to our bunks but nobody slept; we lay waiting for a knock, a key, a footstep. Nothing. Almost till dawn we listened.

Jan broke first—storming round the room, shaking us awake.  
‘Enough lying there! Teacher’s in trouble! Up, damn you!’  
‘Miss the feel of his palm?’ Peter sneered.  
‘Better a thousand slaps than a lifetime of guilt!’  
‘Calm down.’ Peter sat up, pulling on his stockings. ‘Nothing will happen to him; if anyone can defend himself, he can.’  
‘Jan’s right!’ Yakov leapt up, dressing decisively.  
‘Yes! Yes!’ we all clamoured. Only Thomas was silent, picking his teeth.  
‘Coming or not?’ Yakov barked.  
Thomas, unwillingly, hauled himself out.

We found Yeshu at the market on the outskirts, face-down in a pile of rotten fish, fat flies buzzing. He was unconscious, body covered in bruises and cuts. Jan heaved him onto his shoulder to carry him to the road, but Yeshu’s eyes flickered open.  
‘Teacher!’ Jan muttered, overjoyed.  
‘Don’t leave her…’ Yeshu whispered.  
‘Her? Leave whom?’  
‘Her.’ With inhuman effort he lifted a hand, pointing.  
We looked—there lay a woman’s body.  
‘Why drag her?’ Peter grumbled. ‘Just a drunk whore.’  
Yeshu’s hand shot out, gripping Peter’s clothing with surprising force; the pain vanished from his eyes for a moment. He tried to speak, shuddered all over, and passed out.  
Jan glared murderously at Peter. Peter jutted his lip. Yakov and I rolled up sleeves and headed for the woman.

—  

Next morning, the sky was lead. Rain loomed. Waking, I checked on the Teacher. A strange sight.  
Yeshu lay limp on the couch — pale, sleepless, weak. At his feet, kneeling over a basin — the woman.  
Washing them.  
She saw me.  
Paused.  
Felt no threat — kept going.  
I stood there, unable to read it.  
Yeshu: helpless.  
The woman: unknown.  
Two days ago, he was the wilful, feared one. Now she served — without being asked. Not obedience.  
Something else.  
For a second, he looked small. She — regal. Why, I had no idea.

Peter shuffled in — clearly slept in his clothes. Skirt twisted, fake tits down by his gut.  
‘Well,’ — he clapped my shoulder. — ‘How’s life?’  
He looked at Yeshu. — ‘What’s she doing?’  
I shrugged.  
‘Hey!’ — he barked. — ‘You! What are you doing?’  
No answer.  
‘Name?’  
‘Mary,’ she said softly.  
‘Mary, huh… Call me Edward, Mary.’ He laughed. ‘Kidding.’  
He squinted.  
‘Why are you doing that?’  
Mary blinked slowly. Said nothing. Peter smirked.  
‘Back in a sec.’  
He left.  
Came back, muttering:  
‘Mary. Need you. Just two minutes. Gotta fix the boobs. Come.’  
Mary stood. Eyes down.  
Followed him.  
I heard the bolt click.  
I touched Yeshu’s forehead.  
‘Oh, you… Teacher…’  
They were gone seven minutes.  
Peter’s muffled voice leaked through the door. Mary came out at last — still staring at her feet.  
I turned away.  
Peter followed, muttering about a stain on his dress.  
I left.  
Didn’t want to see him check it.
