Participants: Judas, Mary

Ever since Mary moved in, I couldn’t think of anything else. That half-witted girl with eyes black as night hijacked my mind.  
Every spare minute — hers. I hadn’t spoken a word to her. Didn’t need to. Thinking was enough.

Mary, I kept repeating. Mary. Poor hawker from the edge of town. God’s own simpleton — so simple, “godly” fits like a glove.

We pride ourselves on thinking. We theorize. We scratch our chins to look smart, huh.  
But you, Mary — we look up at you.  
Yeah — up. From below.

What’s your secret, God’s creature?  
Your clumsy grace?  
How you give in so easy?  
How you stay quiet when they lift your skirt, silent when their flesh calls?

Why “their”?  
Yakov. Peter. Andrew. Jan. And Yeshu knows it — they’ve all used you, Mary.  
But not me. No, not me.  
I’m scared you’d let me too. Lift your skirt the same way. And then… I’d be one of them.  
Maybe I already am. But I want you to think I’m not.

Yeshu acts like he doesn’t see it. Ignores how you’re used. Why should he?  
He’s married to his doctrine — loyal like a damn dog.

We sit at the table.  
Jan rips meat off a bone. Peter pokes his rice like it insulted him.  
You sit in the corner, silent.  
I don’t know if you eat. Or drink.  
My mind’s elsewhere. No, it’s everywhere. I’m not just in a field — I am the field.

Yeshu talks. I nod when they nod. Laugh when they laugh. Toast when asked.  
But Mary — there’s not a drop of soul in it.  
Not a flicker.

I think of you falling asleep.  
I think of you on market mornings, twice a week, when I drag myself to buy fruit.

“How much?” I ask a cheerful vendor, pointing at tomatoes.  
He cuts off a joke, names the price.  
I start filling my basket.

Then I hear it — traders talking about Yeshu. Nothing new — he preaches more and more. But this time, it’s not the sermons.  
It’s about Yeshu — and Mary.

“Kill me if you must, Moshe,” says the jolly vendor, “I don’t remember his name. I remember him talking about the soul — lonely soul — and the beard. But the name…”  
“They called him Yeshu, Yeshu,” the other says.  
“What does it matter…”  
The jolly man nods.  
“Word is, some Mary — daughter of Shlomo — joined their gang. You know him?”  
“Nope. Don’t know him. But she’s in for it if old Shlomo finds out.”  
“He’s known for ages, Moshe.” The vendor scratches his belly. “Says he’s got no daughter anymore.”  
“Fair enough. And her?”  
“Her? Nothing. Just heard her name’s Mary. Washed some pauper Jew’s feet.”  
“Heard he’s not a pauper Jew at all — some rich native from Australia. Black. Sweaty. Smells like kangaroo shit.”  
They howl with laughter.  
“Likes walking on water!” Moshe grins. “Maybe he floats ’cause he’s part dung?”  
“Forgive me, forgive me!” the jolly vendor clasps his hands. “Feeds a thousand with two fish — such a Jew trick!”  
“A real model of the tribe.”  
“Yeah, I’ll ask him to buy me a Rolls-Royce — on my salary!”  
“Ask away,” Moshe nods, “but beware! The scammer takes a cut of every deal.”  
“A cut? The leather seat from the new car?”  
“No, no — the exhaust pipe. Looks like the swollen hemorrhoids of a provincial queer.”  
Another wave of laughter.

I pay and leave.  
I walk the streets, listening — everyone’s talking about the Teacher. Sometimes they spot me, swarm with questions.  
I slip away.  
Mary…  
I’m so sick of all this.  
Soon I’ll be home — playing that filthy role again.  
I’m tired, Mary…  
By the time I reach the house, it’s already dark.
