Participants: Judas, Mary

That morning, apathy swallowed me whole. I dragged to the kitchen in slippers, avoiding everyone’s eyes. Everything grated on me.  
Grumpy Peter fried something and smoked.  
I waved the smoke away.  
“What?” he said.  
“Wrong side of the bed? Crawl back and try the other.”  
I didn’t answer. Just yanked the fridge open. Near empty.  
“Who ate everything?”  
Peter shrugged.  
Yeshu came in.  
“We gotta go or we’ll be late.”  
“Not going,” I muttered.  
“Why?”  
“Feel like shit.”  
“Final?”  
“Final.”  
“At least walk us to the car.”  
Outside — drizzle in the air.  
(resonate_again())  
Yeshu hunched his shoulders, fixed his beret, spat.  
“What are they doing up there?”  
“Depends who.”  
“Peter?”  
“Fresh stockings. Probably wondering if the boobs need more cotton.”  
“Thomas?”  
“Watching. Throwing barbs.”  
“Mary?”  
“Don’t know.”  
I turned away — though I knew damn well. She was still upstairs. Alone.  
“The fuck…” Yeshu said suddenly. “I left my book there…”  
“Grab it?”  
“Yeah, please…” Yeshu looked at me strange. “No, wait, Judas, leave it there.”  
He tapped my shoulder.  
“What’s with the face?”  
“Feel lousy.”  
I tried to veer off.  
“Teacher, personal question. Jews use a sheet with a hole, right?”  
“Sometimes. Why?”  
“Where’s the hole if it’s for rimming?”  
“Cut it in the underwear. Backside.”  
“But the sheet…”  
“No difference.” Yeshu laughed.  
“Gays breaking tradition, that’s all.”  
He got serious again.  
“So you’re really not coming?”  
“Really.”  
Just then — bang. The door. Peter — flawless in a new dress. Thomas behind him.  
“Mary’s not coming,” Peter sang.  
“She’s unwell,” Thomas smirked.  
Yeshu shot me a long look, then climbed into the car. They roared off.  
I went back in. My head spun: Mary — alone upstairs.  
I climbed.  
She lay curled in Yeshu’s bed, tear-tracks on her cheeks. Yeshu’s book lay open nearby. I took it.  
I sat beside Mary. Stroked her hair.  
“Sleep, Mary… Soon I’ll be gone.  
You won’t have to fear me.”  
Her eyes fluttered open.  
She gasped — I clamped her mouth.  
Tears welled.  
“I can’t change anything,” I whispered.  
“Nothing.”  
I let go.  
She sobbed, turned away. Comfort wasn’t my gift.  
I left, closing the door softly.  
Downstairs — the rain kicked in hard. Drumming a funeral march on the tin gutters.  
Soft. Relentless. Like the future, already closing in.  
But I knew that if self.stuck_in_loop():
