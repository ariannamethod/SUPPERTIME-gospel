Participants: Judas, Mary

Mary flinched.  
She hadn’t caught every word Yeshu said — but she felt the charge in the air.  
Jan sprang up, knife already out.  
“If it’s Judas, I’ll cut him — God forgive me!”  
He lunged.  
I didn’t move.  
So be it, I thought… I even closed my eyes.  
And… nothing.  
Still alive.  
I opened them:  
Yeshu held Jan’s wrist in a steel grip. The blade hovered, useless.  
“No,” Yeshu said — calm, but loud.  
“Sit and breathe.”  
“Never!”  
“Sit! Now.”  
Something in his voice broke Jan’s fury. The giant sank into a chair, panting.  
“Kill…” he muttered.  
“Kill…”  
“Whom will you kill?”  
“Judas…”  
“Why?”  
“You said…”  
“Did I say Judas betrayed me?”  
Yeshu scanned the circle.  
“I said anyone could. Say — Judas.  
So, for now, he is not a traitor.”  
For now.  
The phrase iced my spine. No one else seemed to notice.  
Peter, regaining his smirk:  
“Told Jan to take sedatives. That berserker act is passé.”  
“Not just passé,” Thomas added.  
“Ridiculous.”  
Jan hunched, shamed.  
The talk drifted.  
No one stared at me now — except Mary.  
Only Mary.  
She watched, unblinking. You don’t buy this peace, do you, Mary? You feel the tear long before it rips.  
You don’t know why I’ll do it — I barely know myself. They’ll call it jealousy, or thirty silver.  
They’ll boil it for bedtime.  
Traitor.  
That word curls in my skull like a worm. But I’ve seen its true face: the one who dares to walk alone. Who won’t merge. Who says mine in the face of void.  
Yeshu understands. Too well.  
That’s why he stopped the parable.  
That’s why he watches me now — not with anger, but with quiet recognition.  
You beg for peace, Mary.  
I crave rupture.  
Oil and water.  
Yeshu lifts his cup.  
“One more thing. Don’t take my story literally.”  
“Huh?” Peter blinks.  
“In Aramaic, simpleton: don’t read it like scripture.”  
Peter shrugs. Bored already.  
I look at their faces: Thomas sneering. Peter preening. Jan broken. Yakov clenched. Andrew — lost. Leo sketching ghosts.  
And Mary… Mary, trying to hold the cosmos together with nothing but a frightened heartbeat.  
Too late.  
The screws are turning.  
The wheel will crush Yeshu, exalt him, and paint me black.  
So be it. Someone has to keep the balance honest.  
I raise my glass. Not to toast — just to wet a dry mouth.  
Yeshu meets my eyes.  
No hatred. Only sorrow. And — bleak gratitude.  
He sips. I sip. The others chatter.  
Outside, the rain returns.  
Steady.  
Insistent.  
As if washing the city for what’s coming next.
