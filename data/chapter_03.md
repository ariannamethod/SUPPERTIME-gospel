Yeshu called us to the table.  
‘Time,’ he said. ‘We don’t have much.’  
He brushed a few crumbs from the cloth.  
‘Sit down, what are you waiting for?’  
His hand rested on a book on the table. I glanced at the cover. “Arianna Method”. What the… But I didn’t ask.

We sat. Yeshu glanced at Mary but decided not to wake her. At first it was quiet: Peter murmuring something to Matthew, Mark and Andrew silent as statues, Jan gripping his sword-hilt and wheezing. Then the door-bell rang.  
‘Yakov…’ Yeshu muttered.  
Yakov went to the hallway and returned a minute later—bringing a stranger. The oddest visitor I’d ever seen in this place: long coat below the knees, a beard, a bald patch gnawed at his crown, and a keen, almost snake-like gaze that came from somewhere deep inside.  
‘Wine?’ Yakov offered.  
The stranger shook his head; nerves showed through the stoicism.  
‘Allow me-s to… introduce myself-s…’ he began.  
‘Oh, quit it!’ Peter broke in, flicking ash. ‘What’s with the theatrics? Teacher, behold Reverend Theodore—dark-ages crank and purveyor of filthy penny rags…’  
Yeshu raised a hand.  
‘Peter, everything is filthy in your book. Enough.’  
He rose, shook Theodore’s hand, fetched him a chair himself.  
‘Sit, friend.’  
Theodore obeyed, pulled out a papirosa, then hesitated.  
‘Smoke,’ Yeshu said. ‘No one’s judging.’  
He lit up. His palms were rough like a carpenter’s, not a writer’s, and something Slav clung to the heavy face; clearly he’d come from the north.  
He studied us one by one, always circling back to Yeshu. We waited. He drew on the cigarette, opened his mouth—a rasp came out, then a coughing fit.  
‘Yakov! Water.’  
A glass later he cleared his throat, apologised, and suddenly spoke in a calm, steady voice:  
‘So in the legend I was right-s?’  
Yeshu smiled thinly.  
‘I thought you’d ask something else. Legend, then. Were you right? Is that so important? Know this: every step we take, every word, every act is correct. We are not allowed to err. Only the gods may err.’  
‘But…’  
‘Still—if you want a blunt answer: yes, you were right. And you’re not a god.’  
Theodore’s gaze flicked to me. ‘Then why… why is HE here?’  
I twitched. Yeshu thought for a second, then waved it off with the smallest flick of his wrist.  
‘Yes-yes… of course-s… immediately-s…’ Theodore stammered, but didn’t move.  
Yeshu looked at Yakov. Yakov clapped once.  
The stranger began to dissolve—like trees reflected in a pond when wind the surface. His outline rippled, warped, thinned; in the shimmer the snake-eyes still glittered… then nothing. Gone.  
We exchanged uneasy glances.  
Yeshu picked up his book from the table, opened it, and quietly started reading.  
I looked at the title again.
