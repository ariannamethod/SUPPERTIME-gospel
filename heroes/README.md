# Hero Prompts

Persona prompts for the dialogue characters live here.  Each hero has a file such as `judas.prompt` or `mary.prompt`.

The file format expects the following uppercase sections:

```
NAME: ...
VOICE: ...
BEHAVIOR: ...
INIT: ...
REPLY: ...
```

After editing an existing hero file or adding a new one, send `/reload_heroes` to the bot in Telegram so it reloads the personas.
